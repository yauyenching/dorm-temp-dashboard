  <h3>üîó Check out the live bot on telegram (<a href="https://t.me/WordleScoreboardBot">@WordleScoreboardBot</a>)!</h3>
</div>


## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation ##
This project was bootstrapped .

The bot works by extracting the edition and number of tries from the shared Wordle result and using that information to update the score average, number of games, and streak.

Hence, the data is prone to being corrupted by accidental or incorrect entries. However, I have aimed to minimize this by putting checks in place to ensure no update persists when the edition played has already been recorded or is older than the most recent recorded edition (unless enabled by user).

## üß∞ Dependencies ##
The full list can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/yauyenching/wordle-tele-bot/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building this Project ##
To deploy this application locally, get your own Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), more on that [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)) and create your own MongoDB database cluster. Clone this repository and navigate to its directory. Then, in an .env file in the root folder:
```
API_KEY = <bot token>
MONGODB_CONNECTION = <mongodb connection string>
```
If you want access to the admin debug functions, add your telegram user id in the .env as `ADMIN_ID` as well (you can find out your user id from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)). If not, comment out the debug functions.

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your system if you have yet to do so.  Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

Then, comment out code with `@server.route` decorators, and the `server.run()` function at the bottom of the code. Replace it with:
```
bot.remove_webhook()
bot.infinity_polling()
```
You should then be able to run the script locally and communicate with your bot on Telegram without any issues.

## ü§î Future ##
The following is a list of potential features to implement (as of v1.0):
* [ ] Compose automatic weekly message to show leaderboard for that week
* [ ] Add user function to remove user from leaderboard that has left the chat
